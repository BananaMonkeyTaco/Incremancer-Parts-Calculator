# Incremancer-Parts-Calculator

First off, this will only work off of Kongregate. You can find the alternate site at https://incremancer.gti.nz/ .To install this you will need to have a userscript managers already install, like Tampermonkey. Then you click on the calculator.user.js file in this repository and click the RAW button. This should take you to a page where you can install this script into tampermonkey.

Alternatively you can just copy the whole file and paste it into your web browsers console while on the page. You will have to do it every time you reload the page, but this is a way to get around suspicious downloads.
